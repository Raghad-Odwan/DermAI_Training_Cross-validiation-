## Core Components

### 1. Image Validation Module

A comprehensive pre-processing and verification pipeline designed to ensure data quality before classification.

**Key Features:**
- Correct image format validation
- Proper skin lesion localization
- Absence of artifacts detection (text, borders, stickers)
- Adequate resolution and color profile verification

**Purpose:** This module prevents invalid or low-quality images from being processed by the classification model, ensuring reliable predictions.

### 2. Model Training Pipeline

A robust training framework built on stratified 3-fold cross-validation methodology.

**Training Strategy:**
- Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation (k=3) to maintain class distribution across folds
- Robust generalization on non-seen data
- Stable performance across different data splits

**Technical Implementation:**
- ResNet50 fine-tuning
- Class imbalance handling techniques
- Learning rate scheduling
- Extensive data augmentation

### 3. Ensemble Learning

An ensemble approach combining predictions from three fold-trained models using probability averaging.

**Benefits:**
- Improved stability across predictions
- Higher malignant recall rates
- Reduced variance across folds

### 4. Grad-CAM Explainability

Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) implementation for model interpretability.

**Features:**
- Generates visual heatmaps highlighting influential regions of the lesion
- Improves prediction interpretability for medical professionals
- Provides transparency in the decision-making process

**Purpose:** Enhances trust and clinical utility by showing which regions of the skin lesion influenced the model's prediction.
